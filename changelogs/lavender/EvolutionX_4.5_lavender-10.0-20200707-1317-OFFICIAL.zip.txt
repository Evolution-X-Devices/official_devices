Device changes:
Updated kernel to 4.4.228 - Predator-Stormbreaker v7.8
Auto-brightness works when the device is dozing
Updated Widevine and Clearkey DRM blobs from MIUI 20.7.2
Updated media codecs from MIUI 20.7.2
Enabled WiFi calls in all regions (thx @agritux for the idea)
Updated build FP to Coral - QQ3A.200705.002

Note about Prime Video - My fix broke hardware-accelerated video playback, making the device almost unusable for other content consumption. It was therefor removed until I can find a better fix
