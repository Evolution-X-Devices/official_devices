- Install latest firmware if you're using an older one
- Clean install required coming from EvolutionX A12 or a different ROM
- Dirty flash from previous build is fine
- No Retrofit and no EROFS so make sure to use a compatible recovery, latest official TWRP is recommended (3.5.2-9) and Format Data with this recovery if your previous ROM was retrofit and/or EROFS.
