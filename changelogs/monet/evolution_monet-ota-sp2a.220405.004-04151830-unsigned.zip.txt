IMPORTANT NOTE: We're switching to encryption, like it's done in any normal ROM. It means YOU CAN'T DIRTY FLASH THIS BUILD OR IT WON'T BOOT.
Yes, this also means TWRP will see internal storage as gibberish. But they still boot and you can still use any recovery you like, just be aware that you can flash anything only through adb sideload or OTG.
Thus, I recommend installing PE/Los recovery alongside to have seamless OTA updates.
This is for your security.
Accordingly, the installation instruction for this build is as follows:
1) Backup everything you need using Google/Migrate/MTP or any other tool.
2) Flash this build through any recovery
3) In recovery, press FORMAT DATA
Consequent updates will not require doing this again.

Highlights:
- Deep sleep fixed
- Encryption enforced
- Misc performance improvements
