Note:
==============================
This Build is OSS Vendor based with Android 10 firmware.
Android 11 firmware users kindly don't flash it.
------------------------------
Device changes:
==============================
Improvements in ZRAM Setup:
- Switch to LZ4 for better overall performance
- Set ZRAM disksize to 2GB
- Set max_comp_streams to num of cores(8) since upstream also moves this to
per CPU
- Set page-cluster to 0 as the incremental cost of reading 1 page at a
time is negligible for zram
- Enabled on boot_complete (This help to save ~50ms in boot time and bootanim shown time)

Disabled kpti:
As per qualcomm - "SM8150/SM8250/SM8350/SM7250/SM7150/SM6150 - KPTI Not required".
It can also help increase performance by a lot in some scenarios.

Introduced raise to wake screen gesture.

Added vector icons in parts to make it look nice when enable the
gesture featurs.

Disabled pinning of the camera app to save precious RAM on device.

Updated Redfin's fingerprint to March 2021
