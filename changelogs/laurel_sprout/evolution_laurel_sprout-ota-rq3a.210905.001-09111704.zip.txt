Note:
==============================
This Build is Android 11 firmware based.

You all will receive OTA Updates with Android 11 firmware support. So Android 10 firmware users don't update blindly.

It is a signed build. Everyone is required to clean flash (last time) to experience the best output.

You can expect incrimental OTA updates form next time (we require a file from older build which we don't have currently that's why can't provide incremental ota this time, now I have saved that file already).

Anything regarding FOD is random, so don't expect any specific response. Two users on same build have different response.
------------------------------
Device changes:
==============================
Bluetooth aptX working fine (imported from Coral).
(however, LDAC is not working)

Handle ScreenOffFOD

Fixed voice call volume not changing.

Fixed NetworkTraffic indicator on statusbar.
