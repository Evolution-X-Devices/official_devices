Device changes:
==============================
Firmware, Vendor.img and other image files are updated to Stock Android 11

(Till now they were based on OSS Vendor that's why the users of Stock Android 11
were unable to flash builds which are based on OSS Vendor)

It is strictly recommended that OSS Vendor users do not flash this build.
The build is only for Stock Android 11 users.
