Note:
==============================
This Build is OSS Vendor based with Android 10 firmware.
Android 11 firmware users kindly don't flash it.
We are moved from SELinux Permissive to Enforcing SO CLEAN FLASH THE BUILD.
I am not responsible if enforcing changes to permissive after flashing any custom kernel or magisk module.
Do not request for any inbuilt camera app other than Snap (However you can flash Stock/Miui Camera that have every basic functionality like portrait, 48MP, etc. You can find the magisk flashable module in TG support chat)
