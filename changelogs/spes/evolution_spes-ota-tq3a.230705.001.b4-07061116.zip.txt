BUILD CHANGELOG
· Kernel source are here, but it’s the broken one, keep using prebuilt kernel(updated to V14.0.1.0.TGKIDXM).
· Introducing Camera Indicator. Now a ring will show around the front camera when an app is using it.
· Moved to skiavk(Vulkan) as renderer. After testing for a few days, I don’t see any critical glitches when using it, so let use it for a bit smoother UI.
· Improved brightness and adaptive brightness.
· Improved LMK, powerhint, etc…
· Adjust some paddings and position for better looking UI.
· Fixed some previous issues like Zoom green camera and DT2W not working when device is in sleep state.
· Reworked thermal config. For now the charging speed are better than previous build, up to 43°C. And the Gaming profile will give you more stable gaming experience.
· More and more that I’m to lazy to write down, experience yourself.
