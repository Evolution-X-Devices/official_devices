**Device Changes:**
- Etude kernel: Op.13 No.2
  * built with the latest LLVM Clang 16.0.2 stable
  * backported configurable per-cgroup PSI tracking
  * merged two network related fixes from android common kernel upstream
  * merged `LA.UM.8.3.c25-07800-sdm845.0` into qcacld and qcacmn
  * stopped suppressing all unused argument warnings for clang and removed some arguments from the Makefile
  * DO NOT use another kernel. Just don't.
- Disabled per-cgroup PSI accounting to avoid performance overhead because android does not need it.
- Enabled WiFi Reg Changed event that was disabled in upstream by default.
- Switched to the new open source aptX and aptXHD encoders in the BT stack.

**Evolution X Update**
- April security patch
- The source is rebased after QPR2. Old features may be missing, and new features may show up.

**Known Issues**
- Qualcomm's WiFi Display (WFD) works fine. However, if you have a saved WFD connection, you may see the screen cast logo appear in statusbar after a reboot. Just press disconnect from the screen cast QS tile if that happens.
- If you enable bubble for app notifications, the translucent background may flicker when the bubble is activated.
