**Device Changes:**
- Etude kernel: Op.11 No.5
  * Linux 4.9.282
  * reduced the intensity of TICK haptic effect
  * DO NOT use a third party kernel without proper support for Pixel thermal hal
- Improved the double click haptic feedback to actually feel like a double click
  * you can try it by putting a wrong finger on the fingerprint sensor
- Added the missing libvpphcp.so
- Tweaked the default thermal profile to hotplug two big CPU cores when the device is really hot
  * in terms of thermal mitigation, offlining two CPU cores is a lot more effective than throttling frequencies
  * when the device is under thermal pressure, having two big cores at relatively higher frequencies is generally more advantageous than having four big cores with lower frequencies
  * the gaming profile (under Settings/Battery/Thermal profiles) remains unchanged

**Evolution X Update**
- September security patch
- SafetyNet should be passing again
- Hotspot client manager
- Misc fixes
