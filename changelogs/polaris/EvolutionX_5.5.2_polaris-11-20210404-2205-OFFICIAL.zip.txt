Note: 
Formatting data and clean flash are required if you come from android 10. Please do not update through OTA if you are on android 10.
Dirty flash or update through OTA is fine from the previous EvoX android 11 versions.

**Device Changes:**
- Etude kernel: Op.11 No.4
  * Linux 4.9.264
  * merged CAF tag `LA.UM.9.3.r1-01500-sdm845.0`
  * fixed an issue where the frequency of big CPU cores are locked to a maximum of 1286MHz; the frequency of the big cluster should be restricted under 1286MHz if you battery is at or below 10%, as part of Qualcomm's thermal mitigation, but on previous versions, the frequency restriction was not removed after the phone is charged above 10%
  * default to suspend to RAM instead of s2idle (suspend to idle) for around a 25% reduction of idle battery drain
  * DO NOT use a third party kernel without proper support for Pixel thermal hal
- Stopped enforcing s2idle from userspace init script so the kernel can suspend to RAM for better idle battery drain
- Cleaned some unused config overlays

**Evolution X Update**
- Added Smart Cutoff feature to limit charging based on battery temperature, and improved the logic to work with Smart Charging (based on battery level) together
- More theme changes from android12 DP2
- Many misc fixes
