**Device Changes:**
- Etude kernel: Op.11 No.5
  * Linux 4.9.290
  * DO NOT use a third party kernel without proper support for Pixel thermal hal
- Fixed the smoothness of brightness transitions
  * brightness now changes in the smallest steps possible, so lower brightness range adjustment no longer feels choppy
  * the effect is similar to the hack at the end of android10, but the implementation is much better

**Evolution X Update**
- November security patch
- Misc fixes and improvements
