**Device Changes:**
- Etude kernel: Op.11 No.4
  * Linux 4.9.267
  * some upstream commits of cpufreq_stats
  * enabled CONFIG_XFRM_MIGRATE for IPsec SA (RFC 4555)
  * added a binder flag to clear buffer on txn complete
  * DO NOT use a third party kernel without proper support for Pixel thermal hal
- Updated blobs and firmware from MIUI China Stable V12.0.3.0
- Updated priv-app permission whitelist for HotwordEnrollment
- Adjusted thermal configs to delay CPU frequency drop and smoothen the thermal throttling curve
- Implemented dynamic thermal profile to work with Pixel thermal engine
  * the option is accessible under Settings/Battery/Thermal profiles (in case you are wondering, they had no effect on EvoX before this change)
  * thermal configs are dynamically loaded on a per-app basis
  * only the gaming profile is available besides the default profile, because other use cases are covered well enough by the default profile
  * the gaming profile maintains CPU frequency at even higher temperature compared the default profile
  * surface temperatures are measured by an infrared thermometer with matching emissivity to ensure they stay below the allowed maximum values of continuously held electronic devices in IEC 60950-1 (2005) standard
  * thermal profile is NOT a replacement for proper cooling. If you want better performance, you should cool your device.
- Eliminated most SELinux neverallows and cleaned up unneeded or broken sepolicy
  * the latest Riru installation should work now. Note that if you use any mods like this, you will not receive support from me
