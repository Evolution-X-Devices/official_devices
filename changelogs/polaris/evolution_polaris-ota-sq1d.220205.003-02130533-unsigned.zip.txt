Note: 
- Formatting data and clean flash are required if you come from android 11. Please do not update through OTA if you are on android 11.
- Encryption is disabled for various reasons. You can keep using the latest TWRP or OrangeFox, but please follow the clean flash guide carefully.
- Dirty flash is fine from previous EvoX android 12 builds
- When switching to other ROMs, you may need to re-flash the required firmware, if the ROM you are going to flash does not include one.
