**Device Changes:**
- Etude kernel: Op.11 No.5
  * an upstream fix for PS5 controller HID driver
  * DO NOT use a third party kernel without proper support for Pixel thermal hal
- QDCM rework and Wide Color Gamut support
  * cleaned up and modified qdcm calibration configs for JDI and EBBG panels
  * properly enabled DCI P3 wide color gamut support across the system. Your screen is now able to display more colors, and colors are more accurate.
  * colors in HDR videos are also fixed. HDR videos will be rendered in the correct color space with proper dynamic range.
- Fixed the color mode logic in display HAL
  * your screen now correctly returns to the previous color profile after playing an HDR video or displaying DCI P3 content
  * you do not need to worry about which color profile you use. Even if you use an sRGB profile most of the time, the screen will temporarily switch to a proper profile when the content is HDR or DCI P3, and switch back afterwards
  * additional color mode code to ensure color profile stays the same after reboot
