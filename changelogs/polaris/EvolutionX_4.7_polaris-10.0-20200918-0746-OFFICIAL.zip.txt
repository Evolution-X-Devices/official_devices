**Device Changes:**
- Etude kernel:
  * Linux 4.9.236
  * fpc and goodix fingerprint: use qcom drm notifier instead of the generic one
  * fixed xbl_region reserved memory
  * wireguard: 1.0.20200908
- Reworked screen panel backlight
  * in previous builds
    - adjusting brightness slider in the lower range resulted in uneven brightness transition
    - previous builds did not allow screen to dim to the lowest possible value
    - auto-brightness had slow reaction to ambient light changes
  * patched frameworks/base to use linear brightness slider instead of the log scale one
  * ported gamma-linear conversion to light HAL
  * re-calculated auto brightness curve to fit new light HAL changes
  * reduced light sensor debounce time to stay in-line with MIUI
  * the result:
    - smooth backlight brightness transition when moving brightness slider
    - screen can dim to the lowest possible value the panel allows
    - auto-brightness reacts faster to ambient light changes
    - auto-brightness is no longer jumpy
    - screen dimming caused by no user action has proper transitions
- Fixed an issue where notification pulse option is unavailable when DOZE_ENABLED option is not set yet

**Feature update highlights:**
- September security patch
- Force enabled Styles component
- Added pocket lock
- Improved navbar pulse visualizer
- Replaced Google Sans with Manrope in many system components
