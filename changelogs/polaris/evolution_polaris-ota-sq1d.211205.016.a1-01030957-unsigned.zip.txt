Note: 
- Formatting data and clean flash are required if you come from android 11. Please do not update through OTA if you are on android 11.
- Encryption is disabled for various reasons. You can keep using the latest TWRP or OrangeFox, but please follow the clean flash guide carefully.
- Dirty flash is fine from previous EvoX android 12 builds

**Device Changes:**
- Etude kernel: Op.12 No.1
  * Linux 4.9.295
  * merged CAF tag `LA.UM.9.8.r1-04400-SDM710.0`
  * backported optimizations on qrwlock from mainline kernel
  * backported optimized spinning loop in osq lock
  * reduced cache line size back to 64KB to avoid occasional network packet allocation performance issue
  * dropped unnecessary ndelay in kernel timers because we have queued spinlock
  * DO NOT use another kernel. Just don't.
- Updated DPM, IMS, and RIL system blobs from `LA.QSSI.12.0.r1-05100-qssi.0`
  * missing ringback tone (the one after a call is connected and before the other side picks it up) in some carriers should be fixed
- Switched to CAF's latest IMS RCS implementation
- Updated display HAL and sepolicy from `LA.UM.10.3.r1-00600-sdm845.0`
- Telephoto lens should be selectable in certain gcam ports
  * tested on BSG's 8.1 gcam; BSG's 8.3 does not use the aux camera yet, as the time of writing
